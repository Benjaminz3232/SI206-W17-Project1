Overall Description:
	This is a recreational code which aims to replicate the classic card game: "War". The
	code pits two players against one another many times by randomly choosing cards from 
	each player's deck and playing them against each other unil one player reaches a
	certain number of wins, then program announces the winner as well as the final score.
	The program shows each "war" of two cards in the terminal and specifies who wins each
	time.
